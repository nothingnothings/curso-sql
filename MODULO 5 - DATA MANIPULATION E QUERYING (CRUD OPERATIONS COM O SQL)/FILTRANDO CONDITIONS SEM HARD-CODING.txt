Even though you often will filter with conditions that include a column value that's being compared to a "hard-coded" value (e.g. WHERE salary > 10000), you can also define conditions where you compare columns with each other:





SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > expected_salary;





You will also find more examples for (more complex)
 SELECT statements and WHERE clauses later in the course - 
 especially also in the "Summary & Practice" course section!
